## Insurance Description
A dApp for creating and managing decentralized insurance policies on the Stellar blockchain. Insurers can offer policies in exchange for Lumens (XLM) premiums, while smart contracts handle policy terms, premium payments, and automatic claim payouts.

## Insurance Vision
The vision of the Decentralized Insurance Policy platform is to revolutionize insurance by making it decentralized, transparent, and accessible worldwide. Built on Stellar with Soroban smart contracts, this platform eliminates traditional intermediaries, reduces costs, and ensures trustless payouts for policyholders, empowering individuals and communities with affordable, reliable coverage.

## Key Features
- **Policy Creation**: Insurers can create customizable insurance policies with defined premiums, payouts, and durations.
- **Premium Payments**: Policyholders pay premiums in XLM to activate coverage, managed by smart contracts.
- **Automated Claims**: Claims are processed automatically (via admin/oracle triggers), ensuring fast payouts without manual intervention.
- **Transparency**: All policy details and stats (active, claimed, total policies) are stored on-chain, publicly verifiable.
- **Low-Cost Coverage**: Leveraging Stellarâ€™s near-zero fees, the platform offers affordable insurance options.
